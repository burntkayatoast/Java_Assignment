### 1. Control.java
**Purpose:**
It manages the overall flow of execution, initializes components, interacts with the data and triggers the predictions.
[note to self: edit this later]

---
### 2. FileProcessor.java
**Purpose:**
It interacts with the csv file, contains code to allow reading and writing to the file. 
<br><br>
**Main Methods:**
- `connectFile()`: connects to the csv file for reading and writing.
- `readFile()`: reads the csv file line by line and stores them in an ArrayList.
- `getFileWriter()`: initializes the file write to append data.
- `writeLineToFile()`: writes new lines to the csv file.
- `closeReadFile()` and `closeWriterFile()`: closes the file connections to the scanner and writer.
---
### 3. Features.java
**Purpose:**
Represents a single row in the dataset. It stores the values of the four features and their label so it makes accessing the data easier. 
! The data used was generated by ChatGPT ! 
<br><br>
**Features:**
- Power Status: on/off.
- Network Signal: weak/strong.
- Activity: active/inactive.
- Background Processes: running/stopped.
- Device Status (label: DeviceIsOnline): yes (online)/no (offline).

### 4. Predictor.java
**Purpose:**
Handles the logic of predicting whether a device is online based on the features. 
<br><br>
**Main Methods:**
- `predict()`: compares inputted features with dataset rows, counts the occurences of yes/no labels and returns the most frequent label as the predicted outcome.
- `recalculateClassifier()`: counts the total yes/no labels in the dataset and updates when new data is added.
